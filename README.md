# rock-paper-scissors
here i am going to create a simple implement of the classic game "rock, paper, scissors" at first it is going to be just played within the console using JavaScript, working with functions and variables etc. But i am later going to revisit this project and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text. So by the end product it will showcase my skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript.
on completion of part one (in console game) im happy with what i learnt in the process of this. I had to google quite alot and watch a few differnet videos to help me grasp how to actually put everything together etc. But i am slowly learning and getting more confident as i go on.
